# AI-For-Medicine

Welcome to the "AI for Medicine" repository!

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. This central repository,links to 3 different repositories in which we apply machine learning to concrete problems in medicine:

Feel free to explore the sub-repositories and learn more about how AI is revolutionizing the field of medicine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. [AI for medical diagnosis](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/AI-for-Medical-Diagnosis):
In this sub-repository, we explore How can AI be applied to medical imaging to diagnose diseases? we go over about the nuances of working with both 2D and 3D medical image data, for multi-class classification and image segmentation. We then try to classify diseases in x-ray images and segment tumors in 3D MRI brain images. Finally, we try to properly evaluate the performance of the models.

## 2. [AI for Medical Prognosis](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/AI-for-Medical-Prognosis):  
Machine learning is a powerful tool for prognosis, a branch of medicine that specializes in predicting the future health of patients. In this sub-repository , we go over multiple examples of prognostic tasks, using decision trees to model non-linear relationships, and applying them to predicting mortality rates more accurately. we also  handle unbalanced datasets of patients and missing data, a key real-world challenge.

## 3. [AI for Medical Treatment](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/AI-For-Medical-Treatment):
Medical treatment may impact patients differently based on their existing health conditions. In this final sub-section, we estimate treatment effects using data from randomized control trials and apply tree-based models. we also apply machine learning interpretation methods to explain the decision-making of complex machine learning models. Finally, we use natural language entity extraction and question-answering methods using cutting edge NLP methods to automate the task of labeling medical datasets.
